## Topics

Data Science, Algorithms, linux, python, and web development

## Education

University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB
MSc in Mathematics September 2006

University of Calgary, Calgary, AB
BSc Honours in Applied and Pure Mathematics

## How I Got Here

I completed a masters at the university of Alberta and undergrad in math at the University of Calgary.  I then partially completed a Phd (ABD) in Geophysics.  Even though I'll never complete my phd I learn't a lot, writing, presentations, matlab, signal processing, and simulations of acoustic and anisotropic wave equations. I'm now on the road to learning python and data science.
