Data Science, Algorithms, linux, python, and web development

I completed a masters at the university of Alberta and undergrad in math at the University of Calgary.  I then partially completed a Phd (ABD) in Geophysics.  Even though I'll never complete my phd I learn't a lot, writing, presentations, matlab, signal processing, and simulations of acoustic and anisotropic wave equations. I'm now on the road to learning python and data science.r
