## Git commands

Initiating a git repository from a folder:

```zsh
git init
```
Checking which file differs from current working director and the head:
```zsh
git status
```

List of commits
```zsh
git log
```
List commits with oneline and in graph mode to see branchs,
```zsh
git log --graph --oneline
```

List of all recent git commits including amends and reverts
```zsh
git reflog
```

View all exists branches
```zsh
git branch
```

How to delete a branch
```zsh
git branch -D <branch_to_delete>
```

```zsh
git  rebase
```

## SSH Keys and Passphrases with Github

- Generate a private public key pair
  - The public key in ~/.ssh is .pub file
- Get that key to run with ssh
- Upload the public key to github
- Set the remote with ssh

```zsh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "wardsbd@gmail.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

The command line authenticates with ssh so you have to set the remote with ssh not https. Go to your github page like you were going to find the clone address and choose ssh to down load the correct link.

```zsh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:benwardswards/quartoalgoverse.github.io.git
```

Checking your credentials:

```zsh
ssh -T git@github.com
```
