## SSH Keys and Passphrases with Github

- Generate a private public key pair
  - The public key in ~/.ssh is .pub file
- Get that key to run with ssh
- Upload the public key to github
- Set the remote with ssh

```zsh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "wardsbd@gmail.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

The command line authenticates with ssh so you have to set the remote with ssh not https. Go to your github page like you were going to find the clone address and choose ssh to down load the correct link.

```zsh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:benwardswards/quartoalgoverse.github.io.git
```

Checking your credentials:

```zsh
ssh -T git@github.com
```
