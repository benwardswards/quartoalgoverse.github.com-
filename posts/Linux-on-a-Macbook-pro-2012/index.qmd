## Linux on a 2012 Macbook Pro

I have two former windows machine that are running ubuntu just great.  But the mac runs a little hot and the battery time is reduced.

Computer: 2012 mid 15inch MacBook pro

## What was wrong with MAC OS?

- homebrew broke
- hard to update
- no support from mac
- hard to build anything from source.
- love apt, apt-get, installer, more familar with command line tools on linux.

## Installation

I tried to install many different flavors, making probably 10 different bootable usb keys.  The only way to get the wifi and gpu drivers to install was to use a flavor of Ubuntu.

I need a new hard drive so I thought should take the time to install Linux.


## Extras for Ubuntu

- install zsh
- install oh-my-zsh
- remap caps-lock to control
- remap function key to Control
- install anaconda (for data science and python)
- install vscode
- configure git/github
- adjust to dark theme
- change firefox to dark theme
