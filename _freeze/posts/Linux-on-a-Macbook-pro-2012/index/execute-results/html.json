But the mac runs a little hot and the battery time is reduced.\n\nComputer: 2012 mid 15inch MacBook pro\n\n## What was wrong with MAC OS?\n\n- homebrew broke\n- hard to update\n- no support from mac\n- hard to build anything from source.\n- love apt, apt-get, installer, more familar with command line tools on linux.\n\n## Installation\n\nI tried to install many different flavors, making probably 10 different bootable usb keys.  The only way to get the wifi and gpu drivers to install was to use a flavor of Ubuntu.\n\nI need a new hard drive so I thought should take the time to install Linux.\n\n\n## Extras for Ubuntu\n\n- install zsh\n- install oh-my-zsh\n- remap caps-lock to control\n- remap function key to Control\n- install anaconda (for data science and python)\n- install vscode\n- configure git/github\n- adjust to dark theme\n- change firefox to dark theme\n\n",
